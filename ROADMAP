ROADMAP for Qucs, after 0.0.20

We need to support a file format that allows data exchange to and from other
tools.

Traditionally, Qucs defines a schematic format and a flat netlist format. Both
are tied to a fixed component library, and don't work very well without it.

A new data format will replace the Qucs schematic format. It will be based on
the structural subset of Verilog, an established IEEE standard, after adding a
few conventions [1]. A lossless roundtrip from Qucs schematic to the new format
and back is envisaged and feasible. Among other things it will add

- explicit connectivity,
- port and parameter names,
- self-containedness,
- support for user defined models.

The Qucs flat netlist format only serves the purpose of simulating with
Qucsator, and could be generated from schematics by a stand-alone program.
Generally, other tools should aim to process data from new schematic files
directly, following the the standard interpretation.
